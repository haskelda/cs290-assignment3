Create cs-290assignment3 repo and copy (did not clone) the files into my repo. This took about 20 minutes, before the recorded “Start” time above.  Cloning made a mess of things and dragged in all the history I didn’t want and wouldn’t let me push changes.  So I downloaded the zip file of your repo and copied the files into my own repo.  
	
Began working on the simpler code.  Ran the qunit.html test.  Found strange error about asStringFoo.  Spend 20 minutes reading discussions about it.  Hmmm… something about pulling changes … maybe I do need to clone the repo after all…

Tried cloning again, through “Clone to Desktop” on web GitHub, through GitHub app, and through command line.  Every time, I am denied permission to sync or push changes.  Of course.  Did you mean FORK your repos and clone THAT to my desktop?!

Anyway, back to my first idea of just copying the files downloaded through the zip.

Back to code.
